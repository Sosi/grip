RST is written using wxWidgets, a cross-platform GUI framework that wraps up native graphics API's.  
Most modern OS's come with wx installed by default, though in our experience it often takes some 
poking around or upgrading to work properly.  

Because wx is cross platform, RST can be compiled in windows, linux, or OSX.  The preferred method
of building is now CMake.  See the "doc" directory for details on using CMake to build RST.

We have also included a solution file for MSVS2008, an Xcodeproj file for OSX, a configure script 
for g++ (linux), and a .cproject file for Eclipse (linux).  Documentation for building in each of 
these environments can be found in their respective directories.
