GRIP Simulator GUI
==================

GRIP is written using wxWidgets, a cross-platform GUI framework that wraps up native graphics API's.  Most modern OS's come with wx installed by default, though in our experience it often takes some poking around or upgrading to work properly. It uses the [DART](http://github.com/dartsim/dart) engine for physics simulation. Grip can be used with Windows 7, Linux Ubuntu and Mac OS 10.7 or greater. Installation instructions can be found on [Grip wiki](https://github.com/dartsim/grip/wiki).

Compatibility
-------------------
Currently, the latest GRIP compatible with DART v3.0 is located in the branch release-3.0, so checkout accordingly. Soon we will be updating
the master branch to be compatible with the latest DART as well.
